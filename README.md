	- what are you trying to accomplish here?
	- What are you trying to learn?
	- What project(s) are you working on today?
	- What recent failure have you had?
	- Strengths & weaknesses as it relates to data science or in general?
	
**Storm**
Goal of this group is to ultimately get projects finished and published
- **WHY**
	- We found that it is by working on projects that you actually get to learn and being to understand how to do data science
-  Brainstorm on data science ideas
	- Write them on a piece of paper
	- Go to the front of the group and present it
	- Post your idea on the board
	- Vote for your favorite project with a sticky note  

**Collide**:
- Form teams
- Mix up grade levels/experience
- Discuss **weaknesses**, **technologies**, **expertise**, **talent** 
	- Pick **R** or **Python**
- Establish Communication channels
	- Facebook
	- GroupMe 
	- Slack 
	- GitHub
	- Phone 
	- Gmail/Email

**Homework**:
- Find an ineresting project online/from inertia7.com
	- Read through contents 
- Catch up on your **R**/**Python** skills with DataCamp
- Get to know each other 
- Become Familiar with GitHub

#### **Week 3**: Why a **Data Science Project**?

- What is a **Data Science Project**?

- How to do a **Data Science Project**?

	- Steps of a **Data Science** project:
		- Getting Data
			- **UCI Machine Learning Repository**  
			- **Kaggle** datasets
		- Cleaning data/sanity checks
		- Exploratory Analysis
			- Trends in reponse and predictor variales
		- Modeling (Choosing Supervised Vs. Unsupervised Learning)
		- Model Validation 
		- Sharing Results
			- Inertia7.com
			- GitHub repo with nice READNE.md
			- Jupyter/RMarkdown Notebook  
			
If you don't think you can do a project on your own right of the bat. Try doing a project from **Inertia7**!

- [Scrape a Webpage - Python](www.inertia7.com/projects/scrape-webpage-python)
- [Iris Flower Classification](http://www.inertia7.com/projects/iris-classification-r)
- [Modeling Home Prices](http://www.inertia7.com/projects/regression-boston-housing-r)
- [Forecasting the Stock Market](http://www.inertia7.com/projects/time-series-stock-market-r)
- [Sentiment Analysis on Twitter](http://www.inertia7.com/projects/sentiment-analysis-clinton-trump-2016)

Here are some of my own repos where I have projects that aren't published on **Inertia7**:
- https://github.com/raviolli77/pythonTutorialsVinceLa
- https://github.com/raviolli77/machineLearning_Flags_Python
- https://github.com/raviolli77/classification_iris

- Discuss what their project can look like given the structure of what they just hacked
	- Fill in the **Steps of a Data Science Project**

- **Homework**:
For this section, we can be lenient as to when this gets done. For more advanced groups we expect for you to be able to do this on your own. Now for the newer groups you can wait until the next meeting to have me or other members help with the process.
	- Build a proposal for your own project
		- Abstracts
		- Finish filling the **Steps of a Data Science Project**
		- Requirements
			- Kaggle
			- UCI
			- Data sets found in **R**
			- Quandl
			- API 
				- Wikipedia
				- Twitter
				- Google Maps
				- Saint Louis Federal Reserve
				- Google Analytics
				
If not, then select a project from the suggested list or talk to me for project ideas
