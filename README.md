# Lesson Plan 
##**Week 2**: Introductions
+ Who are you?
	+ Name 
	+ Major 
	+ Year 
	+ Where are you from?
+ Why are you here?
	+ What are you trying to accomplish in life?
	+ what are you trying to accomplish here?
	+ What are you trying to learn?
	+ What project(s) are you working on today?
	+ What recent failure have you had?
	+ Strengths & weaknesses as it relates to data science or in general?
**Storm**
Goal of this group is to ultimately get projects finished and published
+ **WHY**
	+ We found that it is by working on projects that you actually get to learn and being to understand how to do data science
+  Brainstorm on data science ideas
	+ Write them on a piece of paper
	+ Go to the front of the group and present it
	+ Have people walk up to you/you walk up to people, persuade people to be in your group 

**Collide**:
+ Form teams
+ Mix up grade levels/experience
+ Discuss **weaknesses**, **technologies**, **expertise**, **talent** 
	+ Pick **R** or **Python**
+ Establish Communication channels
	+ Facebook
	+ GroupMe 
	+ Slack 
	+ GitHub
	+ Phone 
	+ Gmail/Email

**Homework**:
+ Find an interesting project online/from inertia7.com
	+ Read through contents 
+ Catch up on your **R**/**Python** skills with DataCamp
+ Get to know each other 
+ Become Familiar with GitHub/create account (for more beginner level/those who weren't here, we'll go into more detail in a later meeting)

**Links to Resources** to resources discussed in meeting:
+ **R**/**RStudio**: https://www.rstudio.com/
+ **Python**: https://www.python.org/
+ **Inertia7**: http://www.inertia7.com/

+ **GitHub**: https://github.com/
+ **Slack**: https://slack.com/
+ **DataCamp**: https://www.datacamp.com/
 
## **Week 3**: Why do a **Data Science Project**?

**Some preliminaries**
+ Does everyone in your team have:
	+ **Slack** account/channel within the *dsprojectgroup* **Slack**? 
	+ **GitHub** account?
	+ **R**, **Python**, **SQL** set up on their machine? (Whatever y'all plan on using)
		+ Speak about versions for language and packages/modules. Especially in **Python**:
			+ Speak to me after if you need more clarification 
				+If you can answer this questions then you're fine: Do you know what a virtual environment is? And do you know its use?
				+ If you don't know have your team speak to me after. 
		+ Which interface will your team be using i.e. **Rstudio** or **Jupyter Notebook** for **R** 
+ Introduce the concepts of **Stand Ups**
	+ Structure of an effective **Stand Up**:
    	+ What did I accomplish last meeting?
    	+ What will I do today?
    	+ What obstacles are impeding my progress? (Blockers)
 
+ Document **everything** in your **Slack** channel
	+ If you used a site to review **R**, **Python**, **html**, etc. post it within your group's channel
	+ Read a cool article relating to your project; document it on **Slack**
	+ This will become important when citing sources, creating documentation for project, and just a good habit to develop since people deserve credit for helping you! 

+ **Trello**
	+ Nathan will introduce the interface and how to integrate it into your workforce
	+ We might create a markdown file explaining in more detail if people do not understand how to use it right away (but is pretty easy to use).

## What is a **Data Science Project**?

+ How to do a **Data Science Project**?

	+ Steps of a **Data Science** project:
		+ Getting Data
			+ **UCI Machine Learning Repository**  
			+ **Kaggle** datasets
		+ Cleaning data/sanity checks
		+ Exploratory Analysis
			+ Trends in reponse and predictor variales
		+ Modeling (Choosing Supervised Vs. Unsupervised Learning)
		+ Model Validation 
		+ Sharing Results
			+ Inertia7.com
			+ GitHub repo with nice READNE.md
			+ Jupyter/RMarkdown Notebook  

If you don't think you can do a project on your own right of the bat. Try doing a project from **Inertia7**!

+ [Scrape a Webpage - Python](www.inertia7.com/projects/scrape-webpage-python)
+ [Iris Flower Classification](http://www.inertia7.com/projects/iris-classification-r)
+ [Modeling Home Prices](http://www.inertia7.com/projects/regression-boston-housing-r)
+ [Forecasting the Stock Market](http://www.inertia7.com/projects/time-series-stock-market-r)
+ [Sentiment Analysis on Twitter](http://www.inertia7.com/projects/sentiment-analysis-clinton-trump-2016)


Here are some of my own repos where I have projects that aren't published on **Inertia7**:
+ https://github.com/raviolli77/pythonTutorialsVinceLa
+ https://github.com/raviolli77/machineLearning_Flags_Python
+ https://github.com/raviolli77/classification_iris
+ https://github.com/raviolli77/machineLearning_breastCancer_Python
+ https://github.com/raviolli77/ggplot2_Tutorial_R

Discuss what their project can look like given the structure of what they just hacked
+ Fill in the **Steps of a Data Science Project**

**Homework**:
For this section, we can be lenient as to when this gets done. For more advanced groups we expect for you to be able to do this on your own. Now for the newer groups you can wait until the next meeting to have me or other members help with the process.
+ Build a proposal for your own project
	+ Get comfortable using **Markdown** notation 
+ Create a repo in the [Data Science Project Groups GitHub Account](https://github.com/UCSB-dataScience-ProjectGroup) including these steps:
	+ Abstracts
	+ Finish filling the **Steps of a Data Science Project**
	+ Data Sources? Examples include, but are not limited to:
		+ Kaggle
		+ UCI
		+ Data sets found in **R**
		+ Quandl
		+ API calls: 
			+ Wikipedia
			+ Twitter
			+ Google Maps
			+ Saint Louis Federal Reserve
			+ Google Analytics
	+ If not, then select a project from the suggested list or talk to me for project ideas

## **Week 4**: Project Iteration/GitHub
**Some Preliminaries**:
+ Are people interested in a **Python Hackathon**?
	+ If so when and where works best

+ Has your team created a **GitHub** Repo for your project within the organizational **GitHub** (Source: https://github.com/UCSB-dataScience-ProjectGroup)?
	+ Does it have a **ReadMe** explaining the Steps of a **Data Science** Project?
	+ Did you all agree which versions/interface for the language you will be using? 
	+ Did you reach a conclusion of what models/approach you will take?
		+ If not give us an overview what you plan to do, by the end of this meeting the project should be decided more or less

**Team Resources**
+ Has your team...
	+ Been in contact through **Slack**?
	+ Been doing **Stand Ups**?
	+ Been addressing issues in going about your project or any preliminary practice for your project
	+ Asked for help? 

## **GitHub Crash Course**

Here we're giving a quick overview of how **GitHub** works. Purpose is to be used as a rudimentary guide for those of you who are new to **GitHub**. We can spend an entire day going over the workflow of **GitHub**, but for now we're concerned with just getting your feet wet, and soon creating a repo for your project if you haven't already. 

**NOTE**: One can spend an entire day learning **git**, so we'll leave that out for this iteration. We will provide resources for **git** below!

+ **Step 1:**
	+ Create a **GitHub** account (Should go without saying, but you'd be surprised.)
+ **Step 2:**
	+ You should create a *myProject* folder where you keep all your projects. This will help with organization for later on when you'll be doing a shit load of projects and prior when publishing projects!
	+ Create a folder for your project where you will include things like, but not limited to:
		+ **README** file - This file will be other people's introduction to your project so make it pretty and easy to follow! (in .md format). 
		I use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) to create and edit **README** files (there's a plethora of text editors like **Notepad++**, **atom**, etc. really its all personal preference)
	 	+ Script files - These files will be in the format of the language you are doing your project on so either an **R** file or **Python** file (in **.R** or **.py** or **.sql** )
	 	+ Data file(Not sure what the proper name for this is will edit later) - This file is where your data is stored if you are using a static data source typically it can be:
	 		+ **.csv** file
	 		+ **.txt** file 
	 		+ **.JSON** file
	 		+ **.db** file
	 	+ Image folder - For organizational purposes we usually create an image folder which is where we store all images produced in the project if we plan on hosting them or making them viewable without having to run/save the code. Inside this folder you will find static image files like:
	 		+ **.png** files (favorited in producing statistical images)
	 		+ **.jpeg**
	 		+ **.gif**
	 	+ Once you get more acquainted with **GitHub** there will be more files that you will add, but for this example these will do 	
+ **Step 3**:
	+  Once you have the folder for your project and all the respective files you wish to include in the repo on the main page of **GitHub**, click the green button that says *New repository*
	+ Add the Repo name: we usually name our repos as such 
		+ *statisticalModel_DataSetDescription* 
		Ex. 
			+ *classification_IrisFlowersR*
			+ *regression_bostonHousingR*
	+ Add a description: give a brief overview of what your project will be about to help give people context. 
	Ex. 
		+ *A collection of alternate R markdown templates*
		+ *Repo for a quick ggplot2 tutorial for Exploratory Analysis using Jupyter Notebook and R script*
	+ Leave it as public: Make it accessible to everyone
	+ **Initialize with a README** - ALWAYS **initialize with a README**: this acts as an instructional overview for your project 
		+ You typically include steps that were required that you can't express in your code (i.e. Creating a plotly account, steps needed if there are multiple scripts in your project)
		+ A brief overview of your data set and statistical models used in the project
			+ This will help later on if you plan to publish on inertia7!
		+ Updates made to your project since its last iteration
		+ Look at the inertia7 README's for some concrete examples
+ **Step 4**:
Since you will be working in a team you have to be familiar with **branches**. **Branches** are different versions for the project, so a good way for your group to work on the project without fucking up the **master branch** 

+ (**Master Branch**: This is the version the world will see and use, so make sure that this **branch** is the best iteration/is deployable)
	+ Create a **branch** and call it like **ravi_branch**
	+ You and each person in your team should have a branch that shows your iteration of the project if you happen to go ahead or test something out you haven't spoken with your teammates yet.
+ **Step 5:**
Say you and your group are in agreement that your **branch** is the version you want on the **master branch**, the next step is creating a **Pull Request**.

+ (**Pull Request**: Allows people to review any changes made in a project, make modifications before the **master branch** changes, and overall help a team work efficiently) 
	+ Go into the **branch** you want to merge so **ravi_branch**
	+ Click **New Pull Request**
		+ Here you will see the two **branches** being compared:the **base** will typically be the **master branch** and the compared file will be **ravi_branch** in our example.
		+ Add a description of some of the changes you made!
		+ **GitHub** will give you an overview of the changes made in files
		+ Once you have reviewed everything  click **Create pull request**
		+ This is where other teammates will be notified of you wanting to merge your **branch** and the **master branch** 
		+ If everyone is in agreement you click **Merge pull request**
		+ Then, click **Confirm merge** and the **master branch** will now have the same contents as **ravi_branch**

That's a quick and rough tutorial to working in **GitHub**. Doesn't go over everything but should give context as to how to work as a team using **GitHub** and **branches**. I have provided sources that go in more detail and definitely explain better so I would suggest reading up on them!

**Homework**:
+ Will depend on conversations we have on Wednesday to see where your team is at
+ Have a repo within the organizational repo by the end of today!
+ Create **branches** for each teammate
+ Set up a meeting time outside of Wednesday
