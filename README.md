# Lesson Plan 
##**Week 2**: Introductions
- Who are you?
	- Name 
	- Major 
	- Year 
	- Where are you from?
- Why are you here?
	- What are you trying to accomplish in life?
	- what are you trying to accomplish here?
	- What are you trying to learn?
	- What project(s) are you working on today?
	- What recent failure have you had?
	- Strengths & weaknesses as it relates to data science or in general?
**Storm**
Goal of this group is to ultimately get projects finished and published
- **WHY**
	- We found that it is by working on projects that you actually get to learn and being to understand how to do data science
-  Brainstorm on data science ideas
	- Write them on a piece of paper
	- Go to the front of the group and present it
	- Have people walk up to you/you walk up to people, persuade people to be in your group 

**Collide**:
- Form teams
- Mix up grade levels/experience
- Discuss **weaknesses**, **technologies**, **expertise**, **talent** 
	- Pick **R** or **Python**
- Establish Communication channels
	- Facebook
	- GroupMe 
	- Slack 
	- GitHub
	- Phone 
	- Gmail/Email

**Homework**:
- Find an interesting project online/from inertia7.com
	- Read through contents 
- Catch up on your **R**/**Python** skills with DataCamp
- Get to know each other 
- Become Familiar with GitHub/create account (for more beginner level/those who weren't here, we'll go into more detail in a later meeting)

- **R**/**RStudio**: https://www.rstudio.com/
- **Python**: https://www.python.org/
- **Inertia7**: http://www.inertia7.com/

- **GitHub**: https://github.com/
- **Slack**: https://slack.com/
- **DataCamp**: https://www.datacamp.com/
 
## **Week 3**: Why a **Data Science Project**?

**Some preliminaries**
- Does everyone in your team have:
	- **Slack** account/channel within the `dsprojectgroup` **Slack**? 
	- **GitHub** account?
	- **R**, **Python**, **SQL** set up on their machine? (Whatever y'all plan on using)
		- Speak about versions for language and packages/modules. Especially in **Python**:
			- Speak to me after if you need more clarification 
				-If you can answer this questions then you're fine: Do you know what a virtual environment is? And do you know its use?
				- If you don't know have your team speak to me after. 
		- Which interface will your team be using i.e. **Rstudio** or **Jupyter Notebook** for **R** 
- Introduce the concepts of **Stand Ups**
	- Structure of an effective **Stand Up**:
    	- What did I accomplish last meeting?
    	- What will I do today?
    	- What obstacles are impeding my progress?
 
- Document **everything** in your **Slack** channel
	- If you used a site to review **R**, **Python**, **html**, etc. post it within your group's channel
	- Read a cool article relating to your project; document it on **Slack**
	- This will become important when citing sources, creating documentation for project, and just a good habit to develop since people deserve credit for helping you! 

- **Trello**
	- Nathan will introduce the interface and how to integrate it into your workforce
	- We might create a markdown file explaining in more detail if people do not understand how to use it right away (but is pretty easy to use).

 ### What is a **Data Science Project**?

- How to do a **Data Science Project**?

	- Steps of a **Data Science** project:
		- Getting Data
			- **UCI Machine Learning Repository**  
			- **Kaggle** datasets
		- Cleaning data/sanity checks
		- Exploratory Analysis
			- Trends in reponse and predictor variales
		- Modeling (Choosing Supervised Vs. Unsupervised Learning)
		- Model Validation 
		- Sharing Results
			- Inertia7.com
			- GitHub repo with nice READNE.md
			- Jupyter/RMarkdown Notebook  

If you don't think you can do a project on your own right of the bat. Try doing a project from **Inertia7**!

- [Scrape a Webpage - Python](www.inertia7.com/projects/scrape-webpage-python)
- [Iris Flower Classification](http://www.inertia7.com/projects/iris-classification-r)
- [Modeling Home Prices](http://www.inertia7.com/projects/regression-boston-housing-r)
- [Forecasting the Stock Market](http://www.inertia7.com/projects/time-series-stock-market-r)
- [Sentiment Analysis on Twitter](http://www.inertia7.com/projects/sentiment-analysis-clinton-trump-2016)


Here are some of my own repos where I have projects that aren't published on **Inertia7**:
- https://github.com/raviolli77/pythonTutorialsVinceLa
- https://github.com/raviolli77/machineLearning_Flags_Python
- https://github.com/raviolli77/classification_iris
- https://github.com/raviolli77/machineLearning_breastCancer_Python
- https://github.com/raviolli77/ggplot2_Tutorial_R

Discuss what their project can look like given the structure of what they just hacked
	- Fill in the **Steps of a Data Science Project**

**Homework**:
For this section, we can be lenient as to when this gets done. For more advanced groups we expect for you to be able to do this on your own. Now for the newer groups you can wait until the next meeting to have me or other members help with the process.
- Build a proposal for your own project
	- Get comfortable using **Markdown** notation 
- Create a repo in the [Data Science Project Groups GitHub Account](https://github.com/UCSB-dataScience-ProjectGroup) including these steps:
	- Abstracts
	- Finish filling the **Steps of a Data Science Project**
	- Data Sources? Examples include, but are not limited to:
		- Kaggle
		- UCI
		- Data sets found in **R**
		- Quandl
		- API calls: 
			- Wikipedia
			- Twitter
			- Google Maps
			- Saint Louis Federal Reserve
			- Google Analytics
	- If not, then select a project from the suggested list or talk to me for project ideas

## **Week 4**: Project Iteration/GitHub
**Some Preliminaries**:

- Has your team created a **GitHub** Repo for your project within the organizational **GitHub** (Source: https://github.com/UCSB-dataScience-ProjectGroup)?
	- Does it have a **ReadMe** explaining the Steps of a **Data Science** Project?
	- Did you all agree which versions/interface for the language you will be using? 
	- Did you reach a conclusion of what models/approach you will take?

**Team Resources**
- Has your team...
	- Been in contact through **Slack**?
	- Been addressing issues in going about your project or any preliminary practice for your project
	- Been pulling their own weight? Remember to work as a team and address issues of people not contributing equally (Something that can be awkward to address, but necessary)
